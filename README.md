# Hello, there
#### I just started out on learning Machine Learning, and here is my first commit.
#### First, I built a cool Classifier from sample fruit data (weight and texture) to identify Oranges and Apples ([Hello, ML.ipynb](https://github.com/mmattklaus/hello-ml/blob/master/Hello,%20Test%20ML.ipynb)).
#### Secondly, I build a Classifier for testing Iris flower spices ([Iris ML.ipynb](https://github.com/mmattklaus/hello-ml/blob/master/Iris%20ML.ipynb)), then a similar Classifier with excluded test set and Decision Tree Visualization ([Iris Test ML.ipynb](https://github.com/mmattklaus/hello-ml/blob/master/Iris%20Test%20ML.ipynb)).

#### [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the Library I used. 

### Stay tuned, &nbsp;  :heart: &nbsp;  Matt-Klaus.
