# Hello, there
#### I just started out on learning Machine Learning, and here is my first commit.
#### I built a cool Classifier from sample fruit data (weight and texture) to identify Oranges and Apples.
#### [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is the Library I used. 

### Stay tuned,  :heart:  Matt-Klaus.
